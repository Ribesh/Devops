# Network Policy Issue

## Question

For this question, please set this context (In exam, diff cluster name)

```kubectl config use-context kubernetes-admin@kubernetes```

```red-pod``` , ```green-pod``` , ```blue-pod``` pods are running, and ```red-pod``` exposed within the cluster using ```red-service```  service. and network policy applied on ```red-pod``` pod. problem is now the pod ```red-pod``` is accessible from both ```green-pod``` and ```blue-pod``` pods. fix the issue that ```green-pod``` only can able access ```red-pod``` pod.


## Solution

### Step 1: Verify the Pods and Network Policy
For Pods
```bash
kubectl get po
```

#### Output:
```bash
NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
blue-pod    1/1     Running   0          39s
green-pod   1/1     Running   0          39s
red-pod     1/1     Running   0          40s
```

For Network Policy

```bash
kubectl get networkpolicy
```

#### Output:
```bash
NAME                   POD-SELECTOR   AGE
allow-green-and-blue   run=red-pod    5m17s
```


### Step 2: Edit the Network Policy


```bash
kubectl edit networkpolicy allow-green-and-blue
```

From
```bash
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          run: green-pod
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          run: blue-pod
```

To:
```bash
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          run: green-pod
```

Removed the blue-pod


### Step 3: Verify

```bash
kubectl describe networkpolicy allow-green-and-blue
```

#### Output:
```bash
