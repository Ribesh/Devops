# 2025 Updates In place Resize of Pods

## Understanding Resource Updates in Kubernetes

Before discussing ```in-place``` resizing, it’s important to understand the traditional update process.

-   In Kubernetes version 1.32, *modifying* a pod’s resource requirements in a Deployment **causes the existing pod to be deleted and replaced** with a new one that has the updated resource definitions. 

-   This approach **does not perform changes in place**, and the termination and replacement process can be **disruptive** —especially for stateful workloads.


## In-Place Pod Resource Updates
To mitigate **disruption**, Kubernetes is developing an ```in-place update``` feature for pod resources.

-   This feature is currently in alpha (as of Kubernetes 1.27) and is not enabled by default.

-   To use it, you must **explicitly enable the feature flag** ```"in-place Pod vertical scaling."```
    -   When enabled, additional resize policy parameters become available. 

For example, you can specify that changing the CPU resource does not require a pod restart, while adjusting the memory allocation does.


## Enable Feature Gate on kube-apiserver and kubelet
### For kube-apiserver
-  If you're running kube-apiserver as a static pod (common in kubeadm setups), 
    ```bash
    /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
    ```

-   Add or modify the command section:
    ```bash
    spec:
    containers:
    - name: kube-apiserver
        command:
        - kube-apiserver
        - --feature-gates=InPlacePodVerticalScaling=true    <====
    ```

### For kubelet
-   Modify the kubelet service config (often via systemd).
    ```bash
    /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf
    ```

-   Add to the ```KUBELET_CONFIG_ARGS```:
    ```bash
    Environment="KUBELET_CONFIG_ARGS=--feature-gates=InPlacePodVerticalScaling=true"
    ```

-   Then reload and restart kubelet:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
    sudo systemctl restart kubelet
    ```

## Deployment Example with Resource Definitions

```bash
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app
        image: nginx
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "1"
            memory: "256Mi"
          limits:
            cpu: "500m"
            memory: "512Mi"
```


-   When you update the CPU resource (for example, increasing the request), the pod can adjust its allocation without a restart.
-   Conversely, changing the memory allocation will trigger a pod restart if the restart policy requires it.

## Limitations of In-Place Resizing
While in-place resizing offers benefits, it also comes with certain limitations:
-   **Supported Resources:** Only CPU and memory can be updated in place.
-   **QoS Class:** The Pod Quality of Service (QoS) class cannot be modified through in-place resizing.
-   **Container Eligibility:** Init containers and ephemeral containers are not eligible for resizing.
-   **Immutable Resource Positions:** Once set, a container's resource requests and limits cannot be repositioned.
-   **Memory Limit Constraints:** A container’s memory limit cannot be reduced below its current usage. If an update attempts to lower the memory limit too far, the resize operation will remain in progress until a permissible limit is reached.
-   **Platform Support:** Windows Pods are not supported by the in-place resizing feature at this time.
