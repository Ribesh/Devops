# Cluster Networking
-   We explore the networking configurations necessary for both the master and worker nodes within a Kubernetes cluster.

-   Additionally, every host should have a unique hostname and MAC addressâ€”this is especially important when creating virtual machines (VMs) by cloning existing ones.
