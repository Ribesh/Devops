# Working with ETCDCTL

```etcdctl``` is a command line client for etcd.''

In all our Kubernetes Hands-on labs, the ETCD key-value database is deployed as a static pod on the master. The version used is v3.


To make use of etcdctl for tasks such as **back up and restore,** make sure that you set the **ETCDCTL_API to 3.**

### On the Master Node:
```bash
export ETCDCTL_API=3
etcdctl version
```

Take snapshot
```bash
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints=https://[127.0.0.1]:2379 \
--cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
--cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
--key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
snapshot save /opt/snapshot-pre-boot.db
```

Restore the snapshot
```bash
 ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl  --data-dir /var/lib/etcd-from-backup \
snapshot restore /opt/snapshot-pre-boot.db
```
