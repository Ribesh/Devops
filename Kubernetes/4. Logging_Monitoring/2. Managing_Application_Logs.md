# Managing Application Logs
-   We explore various logging mechanisms, starting with ```Docker``` and moving on to Kubernetes, to help you monitor and troubleshoot your applications effectively.


## Logging in Docker
```bash
docker logs -f <container_id>
```

## Logging in Kubernetes
```bash
kubectl logs -f <pod_name>
```

### Tip

For more effective troubleshooting, **use log filtering and analysis tools** in combination with Kubernetes logs.

## Logging with Multiple Containers in a Pod
If you update your pod definition to include an additional container named image-processor, the configuration will look like this:

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: event-simulator-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: event-simulator
      image: kodekloud/event-simulator
    - name: image-processor
      image: some-image-processor
```

Attempting to view logs **without specifying the container** *when multiple containers are present* will result in an error.

Instead, specify the container name to view its logs:
```bash
kubectl logs -f event-simulator-pod event-simulator

kubectl logs -f event-simulator-pod image-processor
```
