# PV, PVC, Pod

## Question

For this question, please set this context (In exam, diff cluster name)

```kubectl config use-context kubernetes-admin@kubernetes``` 

You are responsible for provisioning storage for a Kubernetes cluster. Your task is to create a PersistentVolume (PV), a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC), and deploy a pod that uses the PVC for shared storage.

Here are the specific requirements:

-   Create a **PersistentVolume** (PV) named ```my-pv-cka``` with the following properties:
    -   Storage capacity: ```100Mi```
    -   Access mode: ```ReadWriteOnce```
    -   Host path: ```/mnt/data```
    -   Storage class: ```standard```
    
-   Create a **PersistentVolumeClaim** (PVC) named ```my-pvc-cka``` to claim storage from the ```my-pv-cka``` PV, with the following properties:
    -   Storage class: ```standard```
    -   request storage: ```100Mi``` (less than)
    
-   Deploy a pod named ```my-pod-cka``` using the ```nginx``` container image.
    
-   Mount the PVC, ```my-pvc-cka``` , to the pod at the path ```/var/www/html``` . Ensure that the PV, PVC, and pod are successfully created, and the pod is in a Running state.

Note: Binding and Pod might take time to come up, please have patience


## Solution

### Step 1: Create PV
```bash
vi pv.yaml
```

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: my-pv-cka
spec:
  storageClassName: standard
  capacity:
    storage: 100Mi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"
```

```bash
kubectl create -f pv.yaml
```

### Step 2: Create PVC
```bash
vi pvc.yaml
```

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-pvc-cka
spec:
  storageClassName: standard
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 99Mi
  volumeName: my-pv-cka
```

```bash
kubectl create -f pvc.yaml
```

### Step3: Create Pod
```bash
vi pod.yaml
```

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod-cka
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: my-volume
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: my-pvc-cka
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/var/www/html"
          name: my-volume
```

```bash
kubectl create -f pod.yaml
```

### Step 4: Verify
```bash
kubectl get po --watch
```

```bash
kubectl get pvc
```

```bash
kubectl describe pvc my-pvc-cka | grep Used
```

Output:
```bash
Used By:       my-pod-cka
```
