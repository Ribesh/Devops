# Shared Volume

## Question

For this question, please set this context (In exam, diff cluster name)

```kubectl config use-context kubernetes-admin@kubernetes```

An existing nginx pod, ```my-pod-cka``` and Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) named ```my-pvc-cka``` are available. Your task is to implement the following modifications:

-   NOTE:- PVC to PV binding and ```my-pod-cka``` pods sometimes takes around 2Mins to Up & Running So Please wait

-   Update the pod to include a sidecar container that uses the ```busybox``` image. Ensure that this sidecar container remains operational by including an appropriate command ```"tail -f /dev/null"``` .

-   Share the ```shared-storage``` volume between the main application and the sidecar container, mounting it at the path ```/var/www/shared``` . Additionally, ensure that the sidecar container has ```read-only``` access to this shared volume.

## Solution


### Step 1: 
run edit pod my-pod-cka command

```bash
kubectl edit po my-pod-cka
```

### Step 2: 
Update sidecontainer and save it

```bash
-   name: sidecar-container
    image: busybox
    command: ["sh", "-c", "tail -f /dev/null"]
    volumeMounts:
        -   name: shared-storage
            mountPath: /var/www/shared
            readOnly: true
```

### Step 3: 
Run kubectl replace command
```bash
kubectl replace -f /tmp/kubectl-edit-1047923679.yaml --force
```
