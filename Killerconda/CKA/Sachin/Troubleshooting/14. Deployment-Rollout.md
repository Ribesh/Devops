```kubectl config use-context kubernetes-admin@kubernetes```

```stream-deployment``` deployment is not up to date. observed 0  under the UP-TO-DATE it should be ```1``` , Troubleshoot, fix the issue and make sure deployment is up to date.

## Solution

### Step 1: Lets check the deployment and pods first

```bash
kubectl get deployments.apps
```

#### Output:
```bash
NAME                READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
stream-deployment   0/0     0            0           68s
```

```bash
kubectl get po
```

#### Output:
```bash
No resources found in default namespace.
```

### Step 2: Lets check in details

```bash
kubectl describe deployments.apps stream-deployment
```

#### Output:
```bash
Selector:               app=stream-deployment
Replicas:               0 desired | 0 updated | 0 total | 0 available | 0 unavailable
```

The replicas is set to 0

### Step 3: Change the replica number

```bash
kubectl edit deployments.apps stream-deployment
```


#### Output:
```bash
"spec": {
        "replicas": 1,
```


### Step 4: Verify
