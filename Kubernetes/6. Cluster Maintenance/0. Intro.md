# Cluster Maintenance Section Introduction

-   We'll cover key areas such as 
    1.  operating system upgrades, 
    2.  node removal, and 
    3.  cluster upgrade processes, 
    4.  backup and 
    5.  disaster recovery methodologies.


## Cluster Upgrade Process
Before upgrading your cluster, it's important to have a **solid grasp of Kubernetes releases, versioning**, and best practices for selecting the appropriate upgrade pathway.

-   Once you understand the upgrade procedure, you'll get hands-on experience performing an end-to-end upgrade on a live cluster running applications.

### Upgrade Planning

-   Before proceeding with an upgrade, always run a pre-flight check using the ```kubeadm upgrade plan``` command. 
-   This command helps you verify the cluster's health and fetch available upgrade versions.

-   To check the upgrade plan, run the following command:
    ```bash
    kubeadm upgrade plan
    ```

-   The expected output will look similar to:
    ```bash
    [upgrade] Running pre-flight checks:
    [upgrade] Making sure the cluster is healthy:
    [upgrade] Config: Making sure the configuration is correct:
    [upgrade] Fetching available versions to upgrade to:
    [upgrade/versions] Cluster version: v1.11.1
    [upgrade/versions] Kubernetes version: v1.11.8
    [upgrade/versions] Latest stable version: v1.11.3


    Components that must be upgraded manually after you have
    upgraded the control plane with `kubeadm upgrade apply`:


    COMPONENT         CURRENT       AVAILABLE
    Kubelet           v1.11.1      v1.11.3


    Upgrade to the latest stable version:


    COMPONENT         CURRENT       AVAILABLE
    API Server        v1.11.8      v1.11.3
    Controller Manager v1.11.8      v1.11.3
    Scheduler         v1.11.8      v1.11.3
    Kube Proxy        v1.11.8      v1.11.3
    Etcd              v3.1.8       N/A


    You can now apply the upgrade by executing the following command:
    ```

### Manual Component Upgrades

After upgrading the control plane with ```kubeadm upgrade apply```, make sure to manually upgrade components like ```kubelet```, as highlighted in the output above.

## Backup and Disaster Recovery
-    This section will guide you through a disaster recovery simulation where you back up your Kubernetes cluster, simulate a catastrophic event, and then restore the cluster to its original state.
