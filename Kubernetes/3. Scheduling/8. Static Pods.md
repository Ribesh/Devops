# Static Pods
-   We explore ```static pods``` in Kubernetes and how they **operate independently of ```controlplane``` components.**

-   Typically, the ```kubelet``` receives instructions from the ```kube-apiserver``` **about which pods to run on its node**

    -    These decisions, made by the ```kube-scheduler``` and stored in the ```etcd datastore```, are standard in a clustered environment.

-   But what happens when the ```kube-apiserver```, ```kube-scheduler```, and other ```controlplane``` components are absent? **How does the node function on its own?**

    -   When the ```kubelet``` and a ```container runtime``` (such as Docker) are installed directly on the host without a Kubernetes cluster, **the ```kubelet``` can independently manage the node.**

    -   In this scenario, because there is no ```API server``` to provide pod details, **you must supply the pod definition files directly to the ```kubelet```.**

### Note
*```Static pods``` are created directly by the ```kubelet``` without the intervention of the ```API server``` or other ```controlplane``` components.*


-   The ```kubelet``` is configured to monitor a designated directory on the host where pod definition files are stored. 

    -   The ```kubelet``` **periodically scans this directory**, reads available files, and **creates the corresponding pods.** 
        -   It also **monitors these pods and ensures they remain running.** 
    
    -   For example, if an application crashes, the ```kubelet``` **restarts it**; 
        -   *If an updated file is detected*, the ```kubelet``` **recreates the pod to apply the changes**; 
        -  *And if a file is removed*, the corresponding pod is also deleted. 

These pods, created solely by the ```kubelet```, are known as **static pods.**

It's important to note that **only pod-level resources can be created this way.** 

-   Higher-level abstractions such as **ReplicaSets, Deployments, or Services** depend on other ```controlplane``` components (e.g., the replication and deployment controllers) and **cannot be managed via the static pod definition files.**


## Configuring the Static Pods Directory

-   You can place static pods in any directory on the host. 
    -   The directory location is provided to the ``kubelet`` at startup by using the ```--pod-manifest-path``` option.

    ```bash
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/kubelet \
    --container-runtime=remote \
    --container-runtime-endpoint=unix:///var/run/containerd/containerd.sock \
    --pod-manifest-path=/etc/kubernetes/manifests \
    --kubeconfig=/var/lib/kubelet/kubeconfig \
    --network-plugin=cni \
    --register-node=true \
    --v=2
    ```

Alternatively, you can specify a configuration file that includes the manifest directory path. For example:
```bash
# kubelet.service
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/kubelet \
  --container-runtime=remote \
  --container-runtime-endpoint=unix:///var/run/containerd/containerd.sock \
  --config=kubeconfig.yaml \
  --kubeconfig=/var/lib/kubelet/kubeconfig \
  --network-plugin=cni \
  --register-node=true \
  --v=2
```

```bash
# kubeconfig.yaml
staticPodPath: /etc/kubernetes/manifests
```

You can verify the status of static pods using container runtime commands. For instance, running the Docker command below on a host shows the containers spawned by static pods:

```bash
docker ps
```

#### Note
In a standalone scenario, use ```docker ps``` because the ```kube-apiserver``` **is not available to process Kubernetes API requests.**


## Behavior When Part of a Cluster

-   Whenever the ```kubelet``` creates a ```static pod``` in this configuration, **it also creates a mirror object in the ```kube-apiserver```. **
    -   This mirror object is **read-only** and can be viewed with ```kubectl get pods```, but you cannot **modify or delete it through the API**. 

-   To update a ```static pod```, **modify the file in the node’s manifest directory.**

For example, running the command below on the master node will display the static pod mirror:
```bash
kubectl get pods
NAME                READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
static-web-node01   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          29s
```

### Note
Notice that the **pod name includes the node name** (e.g., "```node01```") to indicate its origin.

## Static Pods vs. DaemonSets
A common question that arises is how static pods differ from DaemonSets. The table below summarizes the key differences between the two:

![](../../images/kubernetes_static_pods.png)


-   ```Static pods``` are especially useful for deploying ```controlplane``` components themselves. 

-   Once the ```kubelet``` is installed on all **master nodes**, *you can create pod definition files for essential components like the API server and controller manager.*

-   By placing these files in the designated manifest folder, the ```kubelet``` ensures they are running as pods and restarts them automatically if they fail. 

-   When you check the pods in the ```kube-system``` namespace, you'll see these control plane components running as pods—a standard configuration in clusters set up using kubeadm.
