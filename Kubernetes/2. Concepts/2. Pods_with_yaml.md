# YAML in K8s
-   Kubernetes leverages YAML files to define objects such as Pods, ReplicaSets, Deployments, and Services.
    -   These definitions adhere to a consistent structure, with four essential top-level properties: 
        -   apiVersion, 
        -   kind, 
        -   metadata, and 
        -   spec.

## Top-Level Fields in a Kubernetes YAML File
Every Kubernetes definition file must include the following four fields:
```bash
apiVersion:
kind:
metadata:
spec:
```

### 1.  apiVersion
-   This field indicates the version of the Kubernetes API you are using. For a Pod, set ```apiVersion: v1```. 
-   Depending on the object you define, you might need different versions such as apps/v1, extensions/v1beta1, etc.

### 2. kind
-   This specifies the type of object being created. In this lesson, since we're creating a Pod, you'll define it as ```kind: Pod```. 
-   Other objects might include ```ReplicaSet```, ```Deployment```, or ```Service```.

### 3. metadata
-   The metadata section provides details about the object, including its name and labels. 
-   **It is represented as a dictionary.**
-   It is essential to maintain consistent indentation for sibling keys to ensure proper YAML nesting. For example:

    ```bash
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
    name: myapp-pod
    labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
    ```

### 4. spec
-   The spec section provides specific configuration details for the object. 
    -   For a Pod, this is where you define its containers. 
    -   **Since a Pod can run multiple containers, the containers field is an array.** 
    -   In our example, with a single container, the array has just one item. 
        -   The dash (-) indicates a list item, and each container must be defined with at least name and image keys.

    ```bash
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
    name: myapp-pod
    labels:
        app: myapp
        type: front-end
    spec:
    containers:
        - name: nginx-container
          image: nginx
        - name: busybox-container
          image: busybox

    ```

### Creating and Verifying the Pod

```bash
kubectl create -f pod-definition.yml
```

### Once the Pod is created
```bash
kubectl get pods
```

### View detailed information about the Pod
```bash
kubectl describe pod myapp-pod
```

### Apply changes to already running pod
```bash
kubectl apply -f <.....yaml>
```

### Replace pod [Deletes original Pod  and creates new Pod]
```bash
kubectl replace -f <....yaml> --force
```
