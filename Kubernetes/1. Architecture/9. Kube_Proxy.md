# Kube Proxy

-   It has a critical role in **Kubernetes networking.**
    -   In this article, you will learn how Kube Proxy ensures **reliable communication between pods and how it enables Services to function seamlessly across your cluster.**

## Pod Networking in Kubernetes
-   Kubernetes enables **every pod within a cluster to communicate with one another** by deploying a *robust pod networking solution.*
    -   This creates an **internal virtual network that spans all nodes**, connecting every pod.

Imagine your web application is running on one node while your database application is on another node.

-   Though the web application could connect to the database via its pod IP, these IPs are transient and may change. 

    -   The recommended solution is to create a Service
    -   By exposing the database through a Service (e.g., using the name "DB"), the web application can maintain a consistent connection without relying on fluctuating pod IPs.
    -   Each Service is assigned a stable IP address, and traffic routed to the Service is automatically forwarded to the appropriate backend pod.

### Understanding Kubernetes Services

A Service in Kubernetes is a **virtual entity that doesn't correspond to a container or network interface.**
-   Instead, it **provides a persistent endpoint in the cluster's memory, allowing stable access to the underlying pods.**


## How Kube Proxy Works
-   Kube Proxy is a lightweight process that runs on **every node in the Kubernetes cluster.**
    -   Its key function is to **monitor for Service creations and configure network** rules that redirect traffic to the corresponding pods.
        -   One common method it uses is by setting up IP tables rules.

    -   For example, if a **Service is assigned the IP 10.96.0.12,** *Kube Proxy configures the IP tables on each node* so that any traffic directed to that IP is forwarded to the actual pod IP, such as 10.32.0.15. 
        -   This redirection mechanism ensures that Services work transparently across the cluster, regardless of which node initiates the request.

## Installing Kube Proxy
-   Typically, when using kubeadm, **Kube Proxy is deployed as a DaemonSet.** 
    -   This approach guarantees that a **single Kube Proxy pod runs on every node in the cluster.**

#### DaemonSet Deployment

Using kubeadm, Kube Proxy is automatically managed as a **DaemonSet, streamlining the process of ensuring that every node runs a Kube Proxy instance.**


## Verifying the Kube Proxy Deployment

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

```bash
kubectl get daemonset -n kube-system
