# Daemon Set Issue

## Question

For this question, please set this context (In exam, diff cluster name)

```kubectl config use-context kubernetes-admin@kubernetes```

```cache-daemonset``` DaemonSet deployed, now it's not creating any pod on the ```controlplane``` node. fix this issue and make sure the pods are getting created on all nodes including the controlplane node as well.


## Solution

### Step 1: Check the DaemonSet and pod

```bash
kubectl get daemonsets.apps
```

```bash
kubectl get po -o wide
```

It appears the DaemonSet is only running in node01 but not controlplane

### Step 2: Let's check taint on controlplane node

```bash
kubectl describe nodes controlplane | grep -i taint
```

#### Output:

```bash
Taints:             node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule
```

### Step 3: Lets check toleration on DaemonSets

```bash
kubectl describe daemonsets.apps cache-daemonset | grep -i toleration
```

#### Output:
```bash
Tolerations: <none>
```

### Step 4: Edit the DaemonSet to add toleration


```bash
kubectl edit daemonsets.apps cache-daemonset
```


#### Output:
```bash
spec:
    tolerations:
      - effect: NoSchedule
        key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
        operator: Exists
```


### Step 5: Verify

```bash
kubectl get daemonsets.apps
```

```bash
kubectl get pod -o wide
```


#### Output:
```bash
