# Pod Networking

## Key Pod Networking Requirements
-   Each pod gets a unique IP address.
-   Every pod on a node can reach every other pod on that node using its IP address.
-   Pods across different nodes can communicate using a consistent addressing scheme.

These requirements ensure that Kubernetes can support both local (node-level) and cross-node communications without relying on NAT rules.

## Understanding the Basics
Before deploying applications, it is crucial to address several questions:

-   How are pods assigned IP addresses?
-   How do these pods communicate both within a node and across nodes?
-   How can services running in these pods be accessed from inside or outside the cluster?

Kubernetes leaves the implementation details for pod networking to the user, as long as the chosen solution meets the basic connectivity requirements.


## Integrating Container Network Interface (CNI)
-   In our lab setup, we executed scripts manually to configure pod networking.

However, in a production Kubernetes environment where **thousands of pods may be created per minute, this manual approach is not feasible.**

This is where the Container Network Interface (CNI) becomes essential. 
-   CNI specifies how Kubernetes should invoke a networking script each time a pod is created.
-   To conform with CNI standards, the networking script must have:
    -   An "add" section to connect the container to the network.
    -   A "delete" section to disconnect the container, remove interfaces, and free up the IP address.


When the container runtime launches a container, it uses the CNI configuration (provided as a command-line argument) to execute the relevant script with the command "add" and pass the containerâ€™s name and namespace identifier.
