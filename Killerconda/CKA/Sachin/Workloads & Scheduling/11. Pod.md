# Pod

## Question


For this question, please set this context (In exam, diff cluster name)

```kubectl config use-context kubernetes-admin@kubernetes```

Fresher deployed a pod named ```my-pod``` . However, while specifying the resource limits, they mistakenly given ```100Mi``` storage limit instead of ```50Mi```

-   node doesn't have sufficient resources, So change it to ```50Mi``` only.


## Solution

### Step 1: Edit the Pod

```bash
kubectl edit po my-pod
```

```bash
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx:latest
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    name: my-container
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: 50Mi
      requests:
        memory: 50Mi
```


### Step 2: Replace the Pod
```bash
kubectl replace -f /tmp/kubectl-edit-1242103100.yaml --force
```
