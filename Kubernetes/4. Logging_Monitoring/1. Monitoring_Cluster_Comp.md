# Monitoring Cluster Components

-   Because Kubernetes does not include a comprehensive built-in monitoring solution, **you must implement an external tool.**

-   Popular open-source monitoring solutions include **Metrics Server**, **Prometheus**, and **Elastic Stack**. 

-   In addition, proprietary options like **Datadog** and **Dynatrace** are available for more advanced use cases.

## What to monitor

-   Effectively monitoring a Kubernetes cluster involves **tracking metrics at both the node and pod levels**.

### For ```nodes```, consider monitoring the following:

-   Total number of nodes in the cluster
-   Health status of each node
-   Performance metrics such as *CPU, memory, network, and disk utilization*

### For ```pods```, focus on:

-   The number of running pods
-   CPU and memory consumption for every pod


## From Heapster to Metrics Server
-   Historically, Heapster provided monitoring and analysis support for Kubernetes. 
    -   Now, **Heapster**, it has been deprecated
-    Its streamlined successor, **Metrics Server**, is now the standard for monitoring Kubernetes clusters.

-   ```Metrics Server``` is designed to be deployed once per Kubernetes cluster. 
    -   It collects metrics from ```nodes``` and ```pods```, aggregates the data, and retains it in memory. 
    
    -   Keep in mind that because ```Metrics Server``` **stores data *only* in memory**, it does not support historical performance data

## How Metrics are Colllected
-   Every Kubernetes node runs a service called the ```Kubelet```, which communicates with the ```Kubernetes API server``` and manages pod operations. 
    -   Within the ```Kubelet```, an integrated component called ```cAdvisor (Container Advisor)``` is **responsible for collecting performance metrics from running pods.** 
    -   These metrics are then exposed via the ```Kubelet API``` and retrieved by ```Metrics Server```.

## Deploying Metrics Server

### Minikube
```bash
minikube addons enable metrics-server
```

### For other environments, deploy Metrics Server by cloning the GitHub repository and applying its deployment files:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server.git
kubectl create -f deploy/1.8+/
```

-   After executing these commands, you should see confirmation that various Kubernetes objects (such as ClusterRoleBinding, RoleBinding, APIService, ServiceAccount, Deployment, Service, and ClusterRole) have been created successfully.


## Viewing Metrics
Check Resource consumptions on nodes
```bash
kubectl top node
```

Check Resource consumptions on pods
```bash
kubectl top pod
```
