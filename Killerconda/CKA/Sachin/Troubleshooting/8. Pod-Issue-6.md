### Step 1: Check the event of Pod

```

Output:
```bash
Events:
  Type     Reason            Age    From               Message
  ----     ------            ----   ----               -------
  Warning  FailedScheduling  6m23s  default-scheduler  0/2 nodes are available: pod has unbound immediate PersistentVolumeClaims. preemption: 0/2 nodes are available: 2 Preemption is not helpful for scheduling.
  Warning  FailedScheduling  3m29s  default-scheduler  0/2 nodes are available: pod has unbound immediate PersistentVolumeClaims. preemption: 0/2 nodes are available: 2 Preemption is not helpful for scheduling.
  Warning  FailedScheduling  74s    default-scheduler  0/2 nodes are available: pod has unbound immediate PersistentVolumeClaims. preemption: 0/2 nodes are available: 2 Preemption is not helpful for scheduling.
```

There appears to be issue with PVC

### Step 2: Check the Events of PVC

```bash
kubectl get pvc
```

```bash
kubectl describe pvc my-pvc-cka
```

Output:
```bash
Events:
  Type     Reason          Age                    From                         Message
  ----     ------          ----                   ----                         -------
  Warning  VolumeMismatch  6m25s (x5 over 7m23s)  persistentvolume-controller  Cannot bind to requested volume "my-pv-cka": incompatible accessMode
  Warning  VolumeMismatch  3m57s (x3 over 4m27s)  persistentvolume-controller  Cannot bind to requested volume "my-pv-cka": incompatible accessMode
  Warning  VolumeMismatch  102s (x3 over 2m12s)   persistentvolume-controller  Cannot bind to requested volume "my-pv-cka": incompatible accessMode
```

The error shows incompatible ```accessMode```


### Step 3: Check the correct ```accessMode``` from PV

```bash
kubectl describe pv my-pv-cka | grep -i Access
```

Output:
```bash
Access Modes:    RWO
```

The accessMode should be ReadWriteOnce

### Step 4: Edit the PVC ```accessMode```


```bash
kubectl edit pvc my-pvc-cka
```

```bash
status:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
```

```bash
kubectl replace -f /tmp/kubectl-edit-1667350551.yaml --force
```

### Step 5: Verify

```bash
kubectl get pods
```
