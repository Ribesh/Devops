# What is Helm

-  **Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes designed** to simplify application deployment and management. 

-   While Kubernetes is highly effective at orchestrating complex infrastructures, managing individual resources for complex applications can quickly become tedious.

Consider a WordPress site that may require multiple interconnected Kubernetes objects, such as:

1. A **Deployment to run Pods** (e.g., MySQL database servers or web servers)
2. A **PersistentVolume (PV)** to store data
3. A **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)** to access the storage
4. A **Service** to expose the web server to the internet
5.    A **Secret** to store credentials like admin passwords
6.    Additional components like Jobs for periodic **backups**


**Without Helm**, you would **create and maintain separate YAML files for each object** and apply them using individual **kubectl commands.** For example:

```bash
## Secret
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: wordpress-admin-password
data:
  key: CalksdIkeBgmxcv23kjsdIkjr==


## Service
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
  labels:
    app: wordpress
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
    tier: frontend
  type: LoadBalancer

## Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress-mysql
  labels:
    app: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
      tier: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
        tier: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: mysql:5.6


## PVC
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: wp-pv-claim
  labels:
    app: wordpress
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 20Gi


## PV
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv0003
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 20Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
```

**Even if all declarations are combined into a single file, the complexity increases as the file grows, making troubleshooting more challenging.**

## Enter Helm

-   Helm treats **related resources as a single application package**, enabling you to **deploy and manage your entire Kubernetes application with a single command.**


Example:
```bash
helm install wordpress
```

With Helm, configuration settings are centralized in a file like ```values.yaml```, allowing you to customize your deployment effortlessly.


```bash
wordpressUsername: user
# Application password (defaults to a random 10-character alphanumeric string if not set)
# wordpressPassword:
# Admin email (see: https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-wordpress)
wordpressEmail: user@example.com
# First name (see: https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-wordpress)
wordpressFirstName: FirstName
# Last name (see: https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-wordpress)
wordpressLastName: LastName
# Blog name (see: https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-wordpress)
wordpressBlogName: User's Blog!

```

### Helm also streamlines the upgrade process:
```bash
helm upgrade wordpress
```

###  If issues occur during an upgrade, Helmâ€™s rollback feature allows you to revert to a previous, stable release:
```bash
helm rollback wordpress
```

### When it's time to remove the application, Helm ensures that all associated Kubernetes objects are tracked and deleted automatically
```bash
helm uninstall wordpress
```
