# Services Loadbalancer

-   Imagine that these pods are distributed across a cluster—say, a four-node cluster. **To allow external users to access these applications, services of type NodePort were created.**
    -   The NodePort service routes incoming traffic from **designated ports on the worker nodes to the corresponding pods**.

    -   With NodePort, you can reach the applications using any **node's IP address along with its high port number**

    -    For example, if the voting app and the result app are bound to different IP-port combinations, **users could access the application using any ```node's IP address``` and its ```specified port```**, even if the pods are running on only two of the nodes.


### Note

While NodePort works, **it forces users to remember multiple IP-port pairs, which can be inconvenient.**


End users typically prefer a single URL—for instance, ```votingapp.com``` or ```resultapp.com```—rather than juggling several combinations. 
    
-   One approach to provide a unified entry point is to set up a **dedicated virtual machine as a load balancer**, using tools like *HAProxy* or *Nginx* to distribute the traffic across your nodes. 
    
    -   However, managing an external load balancer can add complexity and overhead.

For a simpler solution, many cloud platforms such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP), AWS, or Azure offer integrated load balancing.
-   When running Kubernetes on one of these supported cloud environments, you can simply **change the service type from ```NodePort``` to ```LoadBalancer```** for your front-end services

    -   Kubernetes then automatically provisions and configures a cloud-native load balancer, **providing a single, user-friendly URL to access your application.**

### Important

-   **Keep in mind that the LoadBalancer service type only functions as intended on supported cloud environments**. 

-   In unsupported settings—such as VirtualBox—the LoadBalancer type behaves like NodePort by exposing the service on a high port without providing external load balancing.
