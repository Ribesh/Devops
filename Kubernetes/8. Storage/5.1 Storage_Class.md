# Storage Class Commands

### Step 1: Checking Existing Storage Classes

```bash
kubectl get storageclass

kubectl get sc
```



### Step 2: Working with Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)

-   First, check if there is any PVC consuming a persistent volume (PV)
    ```bash
    kubectl get pv
    ```

-   Next, verify that there are PVCs created yet:
    ```bash
    kubectl get pvc
    ```

-   Create a pvc:
    ```bash
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    metadata:
        name: local-pvc
    spec:
        accessModes:
            - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
            requests:
                storage: 500Mi
        storageClassName: local-storage             # <======
    ```

### Step 3: Deploying a Pod to Trigger PVC Binding
-   Create a file named ```nginx.yaml``` with the following configuration:
    ```bash
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
    name: nginx
    labels:
        run: nginx
    spec:
    containers:
        - name: nginx
        image: nginx:alpine
        volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /var/www/html
            name: local-pvc-volume
    volumes:
        - name: local-pvc-volume
        persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: local-pvc
    ```

-   Deploy the pod with:
    ```bash
    kubectl create -f nginx.yaml
    ```

### Step 4: Creating a New Storage Class with Delayed Binding
-   Finally, create a new storage class called ```delayed-volume-sc```. This storage class utilizes a no-provisioner and employs the ```WaitForFirstConsumer``` volume binding mode. Prepare a file named ```delayed-volume-sc.yaml``` with the following content:
    ```bash
    apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
    kind: StorageClass
    metadata:
        name: delayed-volume-sc
    provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
    volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
    ```
    -   **volumeBindingMode**:

        1.  ```Immediate```: Volume is created as soon as the PVC is created.

        2. ```WaitForFirstConsumer```: Volume is provisioned only when a pod using the PVC is scheduled (helps with zone-aware scheduling).
-   Create the storage class by running:
    ```bash
    kubectl create -f delayed-volume-sc.yaml
    ```

-   Verify by listing all storage classes:
    ```bash
    kubectl get sc
    ```
