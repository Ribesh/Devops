# Why Ingress Rewrite?

## What’s the Problem?

We have two apps:

-   A watch app (shows videos)
-   A wear app (shows clothes)

These apps are available at:

-   ```http://<watch-service>:<port>/```
-   ```http://<wear-service>:<port>/```

But you want to make users access them like:

-   ```http://<ingress>/watch```
-   ```http://<ingress>/wear```

That’s the Ingress URL you’re exposing publicly.

### What is Ingress Rewrite?

- Ingress Rewrite is used to **modify the path** of a request **before it's passed to the backend service.** 
- This is useful when the service expects a different path format than what the client sends.

### What Happens Without Rewrite?

If you don't rewrite the URL path, NGINX forwards the full path to the backend app:

    
-   ```http://<ingress>/watch → http://<watch-service>/watch```

-   ```http://<ingress>/wear → http://<wear-service>/wear```

But the apps don’t understand ```/watch``` or ```/wear``` in their URLs. They only understand ```/```.

So users get a **404 Not Found**.

#### Example
If a user visits ```http://yourdomain.com/myapp```, the backend service receives the full path ```/myapp```.

So if your app expects just ```/```, it won't find the resource and may return a 404 or behave oddly.

### What’s the Fix?
You can strip ```/myapp``` before passing it to the backend by using an annotation like this (in NGINX Ingress):

Use the rewrite-target annotation in the Ingress config:

```bash
annotations:
  nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
```

This tells NGINX to rewrite the incoming path (e.g., ```/watch```) to just ```/```.

So now:

-   User visits: ```http://<ingress>/watch```
-   NGINX changes it to: ```/```
-   Forwards it to: ```http://<watch-service>/```


### The Replace Concept

Think of it like this:
```bash
replace("/watch", "/")
replace("/wear", "/")
```

We’re saying: “whenever you see ```/watch``` or ```/wear```, replace it with ```/``` before sending it to the app.”


#### Ingress Example

```bash
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: test-ingress
  namespace: critical-space
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /watch
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: watch-service
            port:
              number: 8080
      - path: /wear
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: wear-service
            port:
              number: 8081
```

his ensures requests to ```/watch``` and ```/wear``` go to the correct services, but the path is changed to ```/``` before reaching the app.


#### Advanced Rewrite Example
```bash
annotations:
  nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2
```

With Path:
```bash
path: /something(/|$)(.*)
```

Means:

-   Match anything after ```/something``` (like ```/something/foo/bar```)
-   Only keep what's after ```/something/```, and use that as the new path.

So:

-   ```/something/foo/bar``` → ```/foo/bar```
-   ```/something/``` → ```/```

The /$2 is a regex backreference to whatever was matched in (.*).

The ```/$2``` is a regex backreference to whatever was matched in ```(.*)```.

```bash
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2
  name: rewrite
  namespace: default
spec:
  rules:
  - host: rewrite.bar.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: http-svc
          servicePort: 80
        path: /something(/|$)(.*)
```
