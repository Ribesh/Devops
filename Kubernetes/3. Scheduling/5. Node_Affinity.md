# Node Affinity
-   In this guide, you'll learn how node affinity extends the capabilities of basic node selectors by allowing advanced expressions like ```In```, ```NotIn```, and ```Exists```. 
-   This feature enables you to specify detailed rules for pod placement based on node labels.
-   While [Node Selectors](4.%20Node_Selector.md) are simple and intuitive, they lack support for advanced matching operators.

-   **Node affinity overcomes these limitations by allowing more expressive rules.**

*Here, the ```In``` operator ensures that the pod is scheduled only on nodes where the label size includes ‘Large’.*

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: data-processor
      image: data-processor
  affinity:             ## Node_Affinity
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
          - matchExpressions:
              - key: size
                operator: In
                values:
                  - Large
```

*Alternatively, you can use the ```NotIn``` operator to explicitly avoid placing a pod on nodes with specific labels*


```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: data-processor
      image: data-processor
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
          - matchExpressions:
              - key: size
                operator: NotIn
                values:
                  - Small
```

*In cases where you only need to verify the presence of a label without checking for specific values, the ```Exists``` operator is useful.*

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: data-processor
    image: data-processor
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: size
            operator: Exists
```

## Scheduling Behavior
-   Once a pod is scheduled using node affinity rules, these rules are only evaluated during scheduling. Changes to node labels after scheduling will not affect a running pod due to the "ignored during execution" behavior.


## Two primary scheduling behaviors for node affinity:

    1.  Required During Scheduling, Ignored During Execution
        -   The pod is scheduled only on nodes that fully satisfy the affinity rules.
        -   Once running, changes to node labels do not impact the pod.

    2.  Preferred During Scheduling, Ignored During Execution
        -   The scheduler prefers nodes that meet the affinity rules but will place the pod on another node if no matching nodes are available.
