## Question
For this question, please set this context (In exam, diff cluster name)

```kubectl config use-context kubernetes-admin@kubernetes```

You have an existing Nginx pod named ```nginx-pod``` . Perform the following steps:

-   Expose the ```nginx-pod``` internally within the cluster using a Service named ```nginx-service``` .
-   Use ```port forwarding``` to service to access the -  Welcome content of nginx-pod using the ```curl``` command.


## Solution
Use help command ```kubectl expose --help```

### Step 1
```bash
kubectl get pods
```

### Step 2
```bash
kubectl expose pod nginx-pod --name=nginx-service --target-port=80 --port=80 --type=ClusterIP
```

Output:
```bash
service/nginx-service exposed
```

#### Note - Expose command creates a service 


### Step 3
```bash
kubectl port-forward services/nginx-service 8080:80
```
#### Note - port forwards from 80 to 8080 

### Step 4
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080
```
