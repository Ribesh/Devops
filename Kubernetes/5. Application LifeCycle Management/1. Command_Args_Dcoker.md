# Commands and Arguments in Docker

## Understanding Container Commands
-   When you run a Docker container using the Ubuntu image
    ```bash
    docker run ubuntu
    ```

-   Docker launches a container based on the Ubuntu image, which starts and immediately exits since it runs a default process that completes quickly.
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```

-   You will notice that the container is absent because it has already exited. However, viewing all containers—including those that have stopped—with:
    ```bash
    docker ps -a
    ```

-   Reveals that the container is in an "exited" state:
    ```bash
        CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                     PORTS
    45aacca36850        ubuntu              "/bin/bash"         43 seconds ago      Exited (0) 41 seconds ago
    ```

    -   This behavior is different from traditional virtual machines. 
    -   **Containers are optimized to run a single task** or process, such as hosting a web server, application server, database, or performing a specific computation. 
    -   Once the task completes, the container stops because its lifecycle is tied directly to the process running inside it.

## Default Commands in Docker Images
-   Each Docker image contains instructions that define the process to run when a container starts.
-   Many popular images, such as **nginx** or **MySQL**, include a CMD instruction in their ```Dockerfile``` that sets the default command.
    -   For instance, the nginx image typically has the command **nginx**, and the MySQL image uses **mysqld**.

    ```bash
    # Install Nginx.
    RUN \
        add-apt-repository -y ppa:nginx/stable && \
        apt-get update && \
        apt-get install -y nginx && \
        rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* && \
        echo "\ndaemon off;" >> /etc/nginx/nginx.conf && \
        chown -R www-data:www-data /var/lib/nginx


    # Define mountable directories.
    VOLUME ["/etc/nginx/sites-enabled", "/etc/nginx/certs", "/etc/nginx/conf"]


    # Define working directory.
    WORKDIR /etc/nginx


    # Define default command.
    CMD ["nginx"]
    ```   

-   Now, let's examine the Ubuntu image's ```Dockerfile```. Notice that in this example, the **default command** is set to ```Bash```:

    ```bash
    # Pull base image.
    FROM ubuntu:14.04


    # Install necessary packages.
    RUN \
        sed -i 's/# \(.*multiverse$\)/\1/g' /etc/apt/sources.list && \
        apt-get update && \
        apt-get -y upgrade && \
        apt-get install -y build-essential software-properties-common byobu curl git htop man unzip vim wget && \
        rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*


    # Add configuration files.
    ADD root/.bashrc /root/.bashrc
    ADD root/.gitconfig /root/.gitconfig
    ADD root/.scripts /root/.scripts


    # Set environment variables.
    ENV HOME /root


    # Define working directory.
    WORKDIR /root


    # Define default command.
    CMD ["bash"]
    ```

### Note

Remember: Bash is a shell, not a persistent server process. When the Ubuntu container is launched without an attached terminal, the shell exits immediately.

## Overriding the Default Command
-   To override the default command for a container, you can append a command to the end of the ```docker run``` command. For example, this command instructs the container to run ```sleep 5```:
    ```bash
    docker run ubuntu sleep 5
    ```
-   In this scenario, the container executes ```sleep 5```, waits for five seconds, and then exits.

-   If you want to **permanently change the behavior of the image** so that it always runs ```sleep 5```, you must create a new image based on Ubuntu and specify the new default command in its ```Dockerfile```. You can specify the command in either of two formats:
    1.  Shell form:
        ```bash
        FROM ubuntu
        CMD sleep 5
        ```
    2.  JSON array format:
        ```bash
        FROM ubuntu
        CMD ["sleep", "5"]
        ```
-   Build the new image with:
    ```bash
    docker build -t ubuntu-sleeper .
    ```
-   Then run the container using:
    ```bash
    docker run ubuntu-sleeper
    ```

## Configuring ENTRYPOINT for Runtime Arguments
-   Sometimes, you may want to specify only runtime arguments without changing the default command. 

-   In such cases, the ```ENTRYPOINT``` instruction is useful. This instruction sets the executable to run when the container starts, and any command-line arguments provided at runtime are appended to it.

    -   Consider the following Dockerfile:
        ```bash
        FROM ubuntu
        ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]
        CMD ["5"]
        ```
    -   After building and running this image:
        ```bash
        docker build -t ubuntu-sleeper .
        docker run ubuntu-sleeper
        ```

    -   The container executes ```sleep 5``` by default if you don't specify any arguments.
        ```bash
        docker run ubuntu-sleeper
        ```    

    -   You can override the sleep duration at runtime by specifying a new parameter:
        ```bash
        docker run ubuntu-sleeper 10
        ```
        -   This commads runs ```sleep 10```

### Key Difference

-   With CMD alone, runtime arguments replace the default command.
-   With ENTRYPOINT, runtime arguments are appended to the specified executable, allowing you to override just the parameters.

## Overriding ENTRYPOINT at Runtime
-   At times, you might want to completely override the ```ENTRYPOINT```. 

    -   For example, if you wish to use a different command (like switching from ```sleep``` to ```sleep2.0```), you can do so using the ```--entrypoint flag``` in the docker run command.
        ```bash
        docker run --entrypoint sleep2.0 ubuntu-sleeper 10
        ```
