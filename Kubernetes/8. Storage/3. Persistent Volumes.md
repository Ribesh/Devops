# Persistent Volumes
- Previously, we discussed how **volumes** are **defined within pod manifest files**, where the storage settings are directly included in each pod definition.
  - For example, a typical pod configuration with a volume might look like:
    ```bash
    volumes:
      - name: data-volume
        awsElasticBlockStore:
          volumeID: <volume-id>
          fsType: ext4
    ```

    #### OR
    ```bash
    volumes:
      - name: data-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /data
          type: Directory
    ```

-   In environments **where many users deploy multiple pods,** *duplicating storage configuration* in every pod file can lead to **redundancy and increased maintenance efforts.**
    - Any required change would need to be propagated across all pod definitions.   

-   *To solve this issue,* **administrators can create a centralized pool of storage.**

    -   Users then request portions of this storage as needed by creating ```persistent volume claims (PVCs)```. 
    -   This concept is enabled by ```persistent volumes (PVs)```.   

-   A **persistent volume** is a *cluster-wide storage resource* defined and managed by an administrator. 

-   Applications running on the cluster utilize these PVs by **binding to them via persistent volume claims**.

## Creating a Persistent Volume

- In this section, we will create a ```persistent volume``` using a base template. 
  - First, update the ```API version```, set the ```kind``` to ```PersistentVolume```, and give it a ```name``` (for example, "pv-vol1").
    

    ```bash
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolume
    metadata:
      name: pv-vol1
    spec:
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      capacity:
        storage: 1Gi
      hostPath:
        path: /tmp/data
    ```

- Under the ```spec``` section, it's necessary to define the **access modes**.

  1.  **ReadWriteOnce [RWO]**: The volume can be mounted as *read-write by a single node*.
    
  2.  **ReadOnlyMany: [ROM]** The volume can be mounted as *read-only by multiple nodes*.
    
  3.  **ReadWriteMany [RWM]** : The volume can be mounted as *read-write by multiple nodes*.

### Note
The ```hostPath``` option is primarily for **testing** or **single-node setups** and is not **recommended for production environments.**

- To create the persistent volume
  ```bash
  kubectl create -f pv-d
  ```

- After creating the volume, you can verify its status by running
    ```bash
    kubectl get persistentvolume
    
    kubectl get pv
    ```

- Persistent Volume in PODs
  ```bash
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    creationTimestamp: null
    labels:
      run: webapp
    name: webapp
  spec:
    containers:
    - image: kodekloud/event-simulator
      name: webapp
      resources: {}
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/log"
          name: log-volume
    volumes:
      - name: log-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /var/log/webapp
          type: Directory
    dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
    restartPolicy: Always
  status: {}
  ```
