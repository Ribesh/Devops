# Services Cluster IP
-  We explain how Cluster IP streamlines connectivity within a full-stack web application by providing a stable interface for pod-to-pod communication.

## ClusterIP Service Breakdown

-   A typical microservices-based application consists of several pods.
    -   Some pods host a front-end web server, 
        -   while others run a back-end server; 
        -   additional pods manage services like a key-value store using Redis or persistent databases like MySQL. 

    -   The **front-end pods** need to *communicate* with the **back-end services**, and the **back-end servers** must *interact with databases and caching mechanisms.*


-   Because **pods receive dynamic IP addresses** that can change when they are recreated, relying on these IPs for internal communication is impractical.
    -   Moreover, when a front-end pod (for example, with IP 10.244.0.3) needs to connect to a back-end service, there arises the issue of determining which pod should handle the request.

    -   Kubernetes solves this challenge by **grouping related pods under a single service.**
        -   This service provides a fixed Cluster IP or a service name, allowing other pods to access them without worrying about individual IPs.

        -   The service automatically load-balances incoming requests among the available pods.


-   For instance, by *creating a service for the back-end pods*, you can **group them together under one interface.** 
    -   Similarly, *services can be set up for Redis or other application tiers*, ensuring that each layer can scale independently without disrupting internal connectivity.

### Key Point

-   Each *service* in Kubernetes is **automatically assigned an IP and DNS name within the cluster.** 
-   This Cluster IP should be used by other pods when accessing the service, ensuring consistent and reliable connectivity.



### Example: "back-end" Service
Below is a sample YAML configuration for creating a service named "back-end".

-   This service exposes **port 80** on the ```Cluster IP```, forwarding requests to the back-end pods that match the specified labels (app: myapp and type: back-end).

-   The ```targetPort``` is set to ```80```, matching the port where the back-end **container listens**

    ```bash
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
    name: back-end
    spec:
    type: ClusterIP
    ports:
        - port: 80
        targetPort: 80
    selector:
        app: myapp
        type: back-end
    ```

-   To create the service, run the following command:
    ```bash
    kubectl create -f service-definition.yml
    ```

-   After deploying the service, verify its status with:
    ```bash
    kubectl get services
    ```

    -   Output:
        ```bash
        NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
        kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP    16d
        back-end     ClusterIP   10.106.127.123   <none>        80/TCP     2m
        ```
