# Deployments
-   In this guide, we dive into Kubernetes deployments—an abstraction that simplifies managing your applications in a production environment.

- Rather than interacting directly with **Pods** and **ReplicaSets**, deployments offer advanced features that enable you to:
  - Deploy ```multiple instances``` of your application (like a web server) **to ensure high availability and load balancing**.
  - Seamlessly ```perform rolling updates``` for Docker images **so that instances update gradually, reducing downtime.**
  - Quickly ```roll back``` to a previous version if an upgrade fails unexpectedly.
  - ```Pause and resume deployments```, allowing you to implement coordinated changes such as **scaling, version updates, or resource modifications.**

- Previously, we discussed how **individual pods encapsulate containers** and how **ReplicaSets maintain multiple pod copies**

  - A deployment, however, sits at a higher level, **automatically managing ReplicaSets and pods** while providing enhanced features like rolling updates and rollbacks.

## Creating a Deployment
- To create a deployment, start by writing a deployment definition file. 
- This file is similar to a ReplicaSet definition, with the **key difference being that the ```kind``` is set to ```Deployment```** instead of ```ReplicaSet```

  ```bash
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: myapp-deployment
    labels:
      app: myapp
      type: front-end
  spec:
    replicas: 3
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        type: front-end
    template:
      metadata:
        name: myapp-pod
        labels:
          app: myapp
          type: front-end
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: nginx-container
          image: nginx
  ```
- Create the deployment with the following command:
  ```bash
  kubectl create -f deployment.yml
  ```

- Verify the deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl get deployments

  kubectl get deploy
  ```

- Detailed Overview:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe deployment myapp-deployment

  kubectl describe deploy myapp-deployment
  ```

```bash
kubectl create deployment <deployment_name> --image=<image_name> --replicas=<no>
```

## Behind the Scenes: How Deployments Work
- When you create a deployment, Kubernetes **automatically creates an associated ReplicaSet**. 
  - To see this in action, run:
    ```bash
    kubectl get replicasets
    ```

- You'll notice a new **ReplicaSet** with a name derived from your deployment. **This ReplicaSet oversees the creation and management of pods.** 
    - To view the pods managed by the ReplicaSet, run:
      ```bash
      kubectl get pods
      ```


While **Deployments** and **ReplicaSets** work together seamlessly, deployments provide *additional functionalities* such as **rolling updates, rollbacks, and the ability to pause/resume changes**.


### Tips
- To view all the created Kubernetes objects—**Deployments, ReplicaSets, pods**, and more—use the following command:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```
- To view all Kubernetes objects—**Deployments, ReplicaSets, pods**, in all **namespaces**
  ```bash
  kubectl get all -A
  ```
