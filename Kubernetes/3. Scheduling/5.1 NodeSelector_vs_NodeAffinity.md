# Taints and Tolerations vs Node Affinity

Welcome to this article where we explain how to control pod placement in a Kubernetes cluster by **combining taints, tolerations, and node affinity**.

-   In our example, we have three nodes and three pods, each identified by a distinct colorâ€”blue, red, and green. 
    -   Our objective is to ensure that each pod is scheduled on the node with the corresponding color while preventing unwanted workloads from running on these dedicated nodes.

### Key Concepts

In Kubernetes, ```taints and tolerations``` are primarily used to **repel pods from nodes** unless they explicitly tolerate the taint, whereas ```node affinity``` is used to **attract pods to nodes** that satisfy specific label criteria.


## Using Taints and Tolerations
1.  To begin, **we apply a taint to each node** that marks it with its respective color (blue, red, or green). 
2.   Then, each **pod is configured with a corresponding toleration.*

With this setup, the Kubernetes scheduler **places the pods on nodes that accept their tolerations.**
-   For instance, the green pod is placed on the green node and the blue pod on the blue node.

### Limitations
However, while ```taints and tolerations``` ensure that pods with matching tolerations are admitted by the nodes, **they do not guarantee exclusive scheduling.** 

Consequently, a pod (for example, a red pod) might still be scheduled on an untainted node, leading to undesired placements.


## Using Node Affinity
-   To overcome the limitation of taints and tolerations, we leverage node affinity.

-   This method involves **labeling each node with its specific color** and then **configuring node selectors or advanced affinity rules** in the pod specifications. 
    -   Node affinity ensures a pod lands only on the node with the matching label.


-   While node affinity directs pods to the correct nodes, **it does not restrict other pods from also being scheduled on these nodes.** 
    -   This means that although our desired pods are correctly placed, **the nodes might still host pods not meant for them**.


## Combining Taints and Tolerations with Node Affinity
For exclusive node usage, combining both strategies is the optimal solution. The integration works as follows:

1.  Apply **taints on nodes and specify corresponding tolerations** in pod configurations to block any pod without the proper toleration.
2.  Use **node affinity rules to ensure that each pod is only scheduled on a node** with a matching label.

This combined approach dedicates the nodes exclusively to the intended pods, assuring correct pod assignments and preventing interference by other workloads.
