# 2025 Updates Admission Controllers

We explore admission controllers in Kubernetes and understand how **they enhance security and enforce policies before object persistence in etcd**.

-   Every operation performed using the ```kubectl``` command-line utility—such as creating a ```pod```—is first sent as a request to the ```API server```. 
    -   The ```API server``` then **processes the request and stores its information.**

## Authentication
-   When a request reaches the ```API server```, it is first handled by an **authentication** process. For instance, when using ```kubectl```, the required certificates for authentication are provided in the KubeConfig file.

## Authorization
-   After successful **authentication**, the request undergoes an **authorization** process using **role-based access control (RBAC).** For example, a role may be defined to allow specific operations on pods:
    ```bash
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Role
    metadata:
    name: developer
    rules:
    - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["list", "get", "create", "update", "delete"]
    ```

    -   This configuration permits a user assigned to the developer role to list, get, create, update, and delete pods. RBAC rules can be further refined to target specific resource names.

        ```bash
        apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
        kind: Role
        metadata:
        name: developer
        rules:
        - apiGroups: [""]
        resources: ["pods"]
        verbs: ["create"]
        resourceNames: ["blue", "orange"]
        ```

        ![](../../images/kubernetes_core39.png)

-   However, **object-level permissions may not be sufficient in certain scenarios.** When a pod creation request is received, you might need to inspect the configuration—for example, *verifying that the pod does not use images from public registries*, enforcing the use of a designated registry, or *disallowing the "latest" tag.*

-   You might also enforce security policies, such as ensuring the *container is not running as the root user* or rejecting certain capability configurations.

    ```bash
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
    name: web-pod
    spec:
    containers:
        - name: ubuntu
        image: ubuntu:latest
        command: ["sleep", "3600"]
        securityContext:
            runAsUser: 0
        capabilities:
            add: ["MAC_ADMIN"]
    ```

## Admission Controllers
-   Standard RBAC rules operate only at the API level and cannot inspect or modify an object’s contents.

This limitation is overcome by ```admission controllers```, which **validate or even mutate requests prior to persisting objects.** Admission controllers can enforce specific policies, such as:

-   Changing requests based on internal guidelines.
-   Enforcing container image policies.
-   Ensuring that certain metadata labels are always applied.

Kubernetes includes a variety of *built-in ```admission controllers```.* Some common examples include:

1.  **Always Pull Images:** Forces the pod to pull images from the registry every time.
2.  **Default Storage Class:** Automatically adds a default storage class to PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) when none is provided.
3.  **Event Rate Limit:** Restricts the API server’s request-handling rate.
4.  **Namespace Exists:** Ensures that requested namespaces exist before proceeding.


### Namespace Admission Controllers
-   The namespace admission controller **ensures that pods are created only in existing namespaces**.
    ```bash
    kubectl run nginx --image nginx --namespace blue
    ```
    -   And if the "blue" namespace does not exist, you will receive an error like:

    ```bash
    Error from server (NotFound): namespaces "blue" not found
    ```
-   In this situation, after ```authentication``` and ```authorization```, the namespace ```admission controller``` checks for the existence of the "blue" namespace and rejects the request since it does not exist.

-   Alternatively, Kubernetes offers the ```namespace auto-provision admission controller```, which **automatically creates a namespace if it does not exist** (this feature is disabled by default). With the auto-provision controller enabled, executing the same command:
    ```bash
    kubectl run nginx --image nginx --namespace blue
    ```
    -   Results in the automatic creation of the "blue" namespace and a successful pod creation.

### View the **```admission controllers``` enabled** by default, run:
    ```bash
    kube-apiserver -h | grep enable-admission-plugins
    ```

-   This command will list plugins such as  
    1.  NamespaceLifecycle, 
    2.  LimitRanger, 
    3.  ServiceAccount, 
    4.  TaintNodesByCondition, 
    5.  among others. 
    
    -   If you are using a kubeadm-based setup, run the command within the kube-apiserver control plane pod using kubectl exec.

### Enabling Admission Controllers
-   To add an ```admission controller```, update the ```--enable-admission-plugins``` flag on the Kube API server.
    ```bash
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/kube-apiserver \\
    --advertise-address=${INTERNAL_IP} \\
    --allow-privileged=true \\
    --apiserver-count=3 \\
    --authorization-mode=Node,RBAC \\
    --bind-address=0.0.0.0 \\
    --enable-swagger-ui=true \\
    --etcd-servers=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \\
    --event-ttl=1h \\
    --runtime-config=api/all \\
    --service-cluster-ip-range=10.32.0.0/24 \\
    --service-node-port-range=30000-32767 \\
    --v=2 \\
    --enable-admission-plugins=NodeRestriction,NamespaceAutoProvision   #Here
    ```

-   In a kubeadm-based setup, this involves modifying the Kube API server manifest.
    ```bash
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
    creationTimestamp: null
    name: kube-apiserver
    namespace: kube-system
    spec:
    containers:
    - command:
        - kube-apiserver
        - --authorization-mode=Node,RBAC
        - --advertise-address=172.17.0.107
        - --allow-privileged=true
        - --enable-bootstrap-token-auth=true
        - --enable-admission-plugins=NodeRestriction,NamespaceAutoProvision             # <===
        image: k8s.gcr.io/kube-apiserver-amd64:v1.11.3
        name: kube-apiserver
    ```

-   To disable specific admission controller plugins, use the ```--disable-admission-plugins``` flag similarly.


This demonstrates how **admission controllers** not only *reject invalid requests but can also perform backend operations like automatically creating a namespace.*

### Note

-   Both the ```namespace auto-provision``` and ```namespace existence``` admission controllers are deprecated. 
-   They have been replaced by the ```namespace lifecycle``` admission controller, which **enforces that requests to non-existent namespaces are rejected and protects default namespaces** (default, kube-system, and kube-public) **from deletion**.
