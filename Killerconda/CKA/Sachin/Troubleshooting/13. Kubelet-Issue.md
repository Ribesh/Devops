# Kubelet Issue

## Question

For this question, please set this context (In exam, diff cluster name)

```kubectl config use-context kubernetes-admin@kubernetes```

In ```controlplane``` node, something problem with kubelet configuration files, fix that issue

You can ```ssh controlplane```

location: ```/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml``` and ```/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf```


## Solution

### Step 1: Check the Service Status

```bash
service kubelet status
```

Output:
```bash
Active: activating (auto-restart) (Result: exit-code) since Thu 2025-05-15 08:02:39 UTC; 8s ago
```

It is stuck in ```activating``` state

### Step 2: Check the logs

```bash
journalctl -u kubelet.service
```

#### Output:

```bash
"command failed" err="failed to construct kubelet dependencies: unable to load client CA file /etc/kubernetes/pki/CA.CERTIFICATE: no such file or directory
```

Lets check in the mentioned location for this file

```bash
ls -al /etc/kubernetes/pki/
```

There is no such file. The correct file should be ```ca.crt```


### Step 3: Let's edit the kubelet's config file

```bash
vi /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
```

```bash
x509:
    clientCAFile: /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt
```

### Step 4: Restart the service and check status

```bash
service kubelet restart
```

```bash
service kubelet status
```


#### Output:
```bash
 Active: active (running) since Thu 2025-05-15 08:15:22 UTC; 4s ago
```
