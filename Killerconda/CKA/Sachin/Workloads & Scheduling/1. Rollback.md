# Rollback

## Question

For this question, please set this context (In exam, diff cluster name)

```kubectl config use-context kubernetes-admin@kubernetes```

Due to a missing feature in the current version. To resolve this issue, perform a rollback of the deployment ```redis-deployment``` to the previous version. After rolling back the deployment, save the image currently in use to the ```rolling-back-image.txt``` file, and finally increase the replica count to 3 ."



## Solution
### Step 1: 

```bash
kubectl rollout history deployment redis-deployment
```

### Step 2:
```bash
kubectl rollout history deployment redis-deployment --help
```

Output:
```bash
deployment.apps/redis-deployment 
REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
1         <none>
2         <none>
```

```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment redis-deployment --to-revision=1
```


### Step 3:
```bash
kubectl rollout history deployment redis-deployment 
```


Output:
```bASH
REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
2         <none>
3         <none>
```

### Step 4:
```bash
 kubectl describe deployments.apps redis-deployment | grep -i image
```

Output:
```bash
    Image:         redis:7.0.13
```


```bash
echo "redis:7.0.13" > rolling-back-image.txt
```

### Step 5:
```bash
kubectl scale deployment redis-deployment --replicas=3
```

```bash
kubectl get deployments.apps redis-deployment
```

Output:
```bash
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
redis-deployment   3/3     3            3           4m22s
```


```bash
kubectl rollout history deployment redis-deployment 
```

Output:
```bash
REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
2         <none>
3         <none>
```
