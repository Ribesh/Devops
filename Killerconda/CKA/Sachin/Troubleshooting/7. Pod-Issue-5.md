## Solution

### Step 1: Check the yaml file

```

#### Output:
```bash
    requests:
        memory: "150Mi"
        cpu: "15m"
    limits:
        memory: "100Mi"
        cpu: "10m"
```

There appears to be issue with requests and limits:

### Step 2: Fix the issue

```bash
    requests:
        memory: "15Mi"
        cpu: "5m"
    limits:
        memory: "100Mi"
        cpu: "10m"                   
```


### Step 3: Create 

```bash
kubectl create -f redis-pod.yaml
```
