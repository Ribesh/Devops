# Introduction

We will delve into Kubernetes networking with the following sequence:

1.  **Cluster Networking Requirements:** Understand the overall network structure of a Kubernetes cluster.
2.  **Pod Networking Concepts:** Explore how pods communicate within the cluster.
3.  **Container Network Interface (CNI):** Learn how the CNI framework addresses pod networking challenges, leveraging the concepts of network namespaces from the prerequisites.
4.  **Cluster DNS:** Examine how Kubernetes implements DNS internally for service discovery.
5.  **Ingress Networking:** Discover the intricacies of ingress networking, a topic that I have dedicated considerable time to and which is fundamental for managing external access to services.
