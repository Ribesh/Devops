# Backup and Restore Methods

-   In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn how to secure your Kubernetes ```deployments``` by **backing up declarative configurations, imperative resource changes, and critical cluster components such as ```etcd```.**

## What to Back Up

For most Kubernetes ```deployments```, consider backing up:

1.  **Declarative Configuration Files:** Files defining resources like ```Deployments```, ```Pods```, and ```Services```.

2.  **Cluster State:** Information stored in the ```etcd cluster```.

3.  **Imperative Objects:** Resources created on the fly (e.g., ```namespaces```, ```secrets```, ```configMaps```) which might not be documented in files.


### 1. Using Declarative Approach
Creating definition files and applying them with ```kubectl```

Example:
```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
    app: myapp
    type: front-end
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod-definition.yml
```

### Tip
Storing your configuration files in a version-controlled repository **(such as GitHub)** ensures you can quickly restore and redeploy your applications if needed.


## Imperative vs. Declarative Backup Approaches

-   While the **declarative method is preferred,** **sometimes resources are created using imperative commands.**

-   These changes might not be stored in your version control system, which can lead to gaps in your backups.

    -   To capture all configurations, you can query the ```Kubernetes API server``` directly.

- For instance, back up all resources across every      ```namespace``` by running:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all --all-namespaces -o yaml > all-deploy-services.yaml
  ```

  - This command generates a **comprehensive YAML snapshot of pods, deployments, services, and other resources.** 

To simplify and automate this process in production, consider using tools like **Velero**.
