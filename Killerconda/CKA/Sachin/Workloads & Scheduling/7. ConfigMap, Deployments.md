# Config Map, Deployments

## Question

For this question, please set this context (In exam, diff cluster name)

```kubectl config use-context kubernetes-admin@kubernetes```

Within the default namespace, there is a web application deployment named ```webapp-deployment``` that relies on an environment variable that can change frequently. You need to manage this environment variable using a ConfigMap. Follow these steps:

-   Create a new ConfigMap named ```webapp-deployment-config-map``` with the key-value pair ```APPLICATION=web-app``` .
-   Update the deployment ```webapp-deployment``` to utilize the newly created ConfigMap.


## Solution

### Step 1: Create ConfigMap
```bash
kubectl create configmap webapp-deployment-config-map --from-literal=APPLICATION=web-app
```

```bash
kubectl describe configmaps webapp-deployment-config-map
```

Output:
```bash
Name:         webapp-deployment-config-map
Namespace:    default
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  <none>

Data
====
APPLICATION:
----
web-app


BinaryData
====

Events:  <none>
```

### Step 2: Edit Deployment


```bash
kubectl edit deployments.apps webapp-deployment
```

```bash
spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        - name: APPLICATION
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              key: APPLICATION
              name: webapp-deployment-config-map
```

Output:
```bash
deployment.apps/webapp-deployment edited
```
