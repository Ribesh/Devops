# Storage Class, Persistent Volume, Persistent Volume Claim, Pod

## Question

For this question, please set this context (In exam, diff cluster name)

```kubectl config use-context kubernetes-admin@kubernetes```

Your task involves setting up storage components in a Kubernetes cluster. Follow these steps:

Step 1: Create a **Storage Class** named ```blue-stc-cka``` with the following properties:

-   Provisioner: ```kubernetes.io/no-provisioner```
-   Volume binding mode: ```WaitForFirstConsumer```

Step 2: Create a **Persistent Volume (PV)** named blue-pv-cka with the following properties:

-   Capacity: ```100Mi```
-   Access mode: ```ReadWriteOnce```
-   Reclaim policy: ```Retain```
-   Storage class: ```blue-stc-cka```
-   Local path: ```/opt/blue-data-cka```
-   Node affinity: Set node affinity to create this PV on ```controlplane``` .

Step 3: Create a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) named ```blue-pvc-cka``` with the following properties:

-   Access mode: ```ReadWriteOnce```
-   Storage class: ```blue-stc-cka```
-   Storage request: ```50Mi```
-   The volume should be bound to ```blue-pv-cka```
