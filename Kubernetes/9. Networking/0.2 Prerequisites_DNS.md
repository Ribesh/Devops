# Prerequisite DNS


https://notes.kodekloud.com/docs/CKA-Certification-Course-Certified-Kubernetes-Administrator/Networking/Prerequisite-DNS



Every time you reference a host by name—whether by ping, SSH, or curl—the system consults the ```/etc/hosts``` file for IP address mapping. This process is called **name resolution**

```bash
cat >> /etc/hosts
192.168.1.11    db
192.168.1.11    www.google.com


ping db
ssh db
curl http://www.google.com
```

### Warning

While managing local /etc/hosts files works for small networks, it becomes difficult to maintain as the number of systems grows and IP addresses change.
