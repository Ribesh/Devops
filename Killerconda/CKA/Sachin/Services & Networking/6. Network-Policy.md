# Network Policy

## Question
For this question, please set this context (In exam, diff cluster name)

```kubectl config use-context kubernetes-admin@kubernetes```

```my-app-deployment``` and ```cache-deployment``` deployed, and ```my-app-deployment``` deployment exposed through a service named ```my-app-service``` . Create a **NetworkPolicy** named ```my-app-network-policy``` to restrict incoming and outgoing traffic to ```my-app-deployment pods``` with the following specifications:

-   Allow incoming traffic only from pods.
-   Allow incoming traffic from a specific pod with the label ```app=trusted```
-   Allow outgoing traffic to pods.
-   Deny all other incoming and outgoing traffic


## Solution
### Step 1

```bash
kubectl get deploy
```

### Step 2
To create the Network Policy, copy a template from official documemtation
```bash
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: test-network-policy
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: db
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 172.17.0.0/16
        except:
        - 172.17.1.0/24
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          project: myproject
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: frontend
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 6379
  egress:
  - to:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 10.0.0.0/24
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 5978
```

### Step 3 
Check the Labels used in deployments 
```bash
kubectl describe deployments.apps my-app-deployment 
```

Output:
```bash
Selector:               app=my-app
```

### Step 4
Edit the yaml file as required

```bash
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: my-app-network-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector: {}
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: trusted
  egress:
  - to:
    - podSelector: {}
```

### Step 5
```bash
kubectl create -f network-policy.yaml
```

OR 
```bash
kubectl apply -f network-policy.yaml
```
